  The growth and decline of community are less apparent when it comes to number of questions and answers. Since the forum maintains rather stable count of posts with more answers than questions each day, we could infer that despite the significant decrease of user base, there is still a dedicated niche of users tiying the community together. Also note the spikes between April and May of 2019 following the premier of "Avengers: Endgame".
