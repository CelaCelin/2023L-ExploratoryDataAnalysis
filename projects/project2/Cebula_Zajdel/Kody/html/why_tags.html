  A tag is a word or phrase, usually marked between '<>' braces, that describes the topic of the question. Tags are means of connecting experts with questions they will be able to answer by sorting questions into specific, well-defined categories. They can also be used to help users identify questions that are interesting or relevant to them. For example, a user looking for answers regarding their favourite movie will find answers under a tag named after the movie's title. Since tagging posts is such a fundamental feature of a modern community forum, we can expect that common tags will provide an inshight into relationship between viewers and the film industry.
