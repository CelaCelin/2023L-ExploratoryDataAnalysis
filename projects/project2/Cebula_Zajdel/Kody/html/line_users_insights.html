  Most noticeable feature of the plot is the persistent growth of the community till the end of 2018 succeeded by its persistent decline. It is unclear what was the cause of such a turn of events. Is it the case that Movies & TV Stack Exchange community, or maybe Stack Exchange community overall, have become unwelcome for new users?
