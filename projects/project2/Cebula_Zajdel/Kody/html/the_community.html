  By community we mean people who are considered as a unit because of their common interests. Premiers and large cinema events evoke emotions among movie admirers, so after watching a new film or trailer, the viewers will want to share their impressions and insights with each other, so they ask questions regarding their doubts on online discussion platforms in order to obtain a response from one of more experienced movie enthusiasts. And that's how through film industry a community is born. Since films and public forums share a dynamic and interconnected relationship, it is worth to take a look at how the example of such an "ecosystem" evolves.
